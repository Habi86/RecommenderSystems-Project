# Baseline recommenders:
# First, implement two simple baseline algorithms against which you compare your more sophisticated recommenders:
# one that recommends randomly selected artists the target user has not listened to before and
# one that recommends artists listened to by randomly selected users
# (of course, excluding artists already known by the target user, i.e. artists in the 'training set').
# Implement them as functions recommend_RB_artist and recommend_RB_user.
